Hello Everyone,

In this project, I have been working on the level design for a 2D snowboarding game. 
The character's movements are controlled using a torque system with the left and right arrow keys. 
When the character dies or crosses the finish line, the level restarts. 
Currently, I am working on particle systems that will indicate when the character hits their head on the ground or crosses the finish line. 
Gameplay mechanics will be added in the coming days. 
Stay tuned for updates!

Best regards,  
Kerem Gavcar
